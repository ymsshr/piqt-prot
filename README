PIQT is a Java implementation of a peer-to-peer based distributed
pub/sub broker. PIQT connects applications via topic-base pub/sub
(Conforms MQTT 3.1 standard). PIQT is based on a distributed
edge-broker model. It connects brokers via P2P structured overlays.

PIQT is an abbreviation of "P2P Integrated Qualified/Quick TBPS"
or maybe "PIax and mQTt" :).
